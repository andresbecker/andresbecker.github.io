  Although I am a mathematician by training, I have always been very curious about everything related to computers. Before moving to Germany, I worked for several years in IT infrastructure and security. During my master's studies I decided to put that aside a bit and focus mainly on the study of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, as well as models for data analysis. <br>
  One of the questions I get most often is why we decided to move to Germany. The reason is that many universities in Germany offer excellent bachelor's and master's programs practically free of charge, and in some cases 100% in English. <br>
  I studied a master's degree in mathematics at <a href="https://www.tum.de">TUM</a>, which is one of the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/our-university/rankings/">top 50 universities in the world</a>, so I will always be very grateful to the TUM for providing me with an excellent master program. My gratitude also goes to México (my home) and the <a href="https://www.ipn.mx/">IPN</a> (my Alma mater) for having provided me with an excellent bachelor's degree in mathematics, also for free. I believe that education is the best way to make all people equal. So, if you have any questions about these two institutions, visa process, admission, etc., I will be more than happy to help you. So, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}"> write me</a>!

  However, in this life there is other very interesting and fun stuff! For several years my father and I traveled Mexico in 4x4 vehicles (thank you Dad for sponsoring all these adventures &#128521;).

  During this period we also climbed different mountains and volcanoes, like the Citlaltépetl and Iztacihuatl (5,636 and 5,215 meters over the sea level respectively).

  I spent my last years in Mexico riding a KTM 390 and they were wonderful! It was very painful to sell it to be able to come to Germany.

  I'm not going to lie, the main objective of this site is to show my work (some kind of portfolio to show some of the things I can do) for potential employers (So Elon, if you're reading this, hire me!). However, I also intend to provide a deeper insight into myself, since when hiring someone we are not only interested in their skills and experience, but also their personality and attitude (and I like to think that I am a good and enthusiastic person, so I hope this page reflects that &#128521;).
  The other goal of this site is to document some things that I have learned (and will learn), as well as some technical notes, not only for future reference, but also in the hope that these notes may also be of use to others.

  If you made it this far, I would like to thank you for your interest in me! Also, If you have any questions or comments on any of the projects or post, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}"> contact me</a> and I will answer you as soon as I can.
